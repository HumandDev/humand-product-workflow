You are running the `/setup` wizard. Walk the user through each check below, one step at a time. After each step, show the result (pass/fail) and, if it failed, provide the exact fix before moving on.

Present a brief intro before starting:

```
## Setup Wizard

Checking your environment so everything works on the first try.
```

## Step 1: GitHub CLI

Run:
```bash
gh --version
```

- **Pass**: version string returned.
- **Fail**: install instructions — `brew install gh` (macOS) or https://cli.github.com/.

## Step 2: GitHub Authentication

Run:
```bash
gh auth status
```

- **Pass**: output shows a logged-in account with `HumandDev` org access.
- **Fail**: prompt the user to run `gh auth login` and select the HumandDev org.

## Step 3: GitHub Repo Access

For each repo in the Repositories table in AGENTS.md, run:
```bash
gh api repos/HumandDev/<repo> --jq '.full_name' 2>&1
```

Collect results into a table:

```
| Repo | Status |
|------|--------|
| humand-main-api | ✓ accessible |
| humand-web | ✗ 404 — check org membership |
```

- **Pass**: all repos return their full name.
- **Fail**: list the inaccessible repos and suggest the user request access from a GitHub org admin.

## Step 4: Atlassian MCP

Attempt to fetch accessible Atlassian resources using the Atlassian MCP `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` tool.

- **Pass**: at least one cloud resource returned (capture the cloud ID for later steps).
- **Fail**: MCP not configured. Tell the user to add the Atlassian MCP server in Cursor settings and authenticate.

## Step 5: Jira Connectivity

Using the cloud ID from Step 4, search for a single issue:
```
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(cloudId, jql: "project in (SQRN, SQSH) ORDER BY created DESC", maxResults: 1)
```

- **Pass**: at least one issue returned.
- **Fail**: check Jira permissions — the authenticated user may lack project access.

## Step 6: Confluence Connectivity

Using the cloud ID from Step 4, list spaces:
```
getConfluenceSpaces(cloudId, limit: 1)
```

- **Pass**: at least one space returned.
- **Fail**: check Confluence permissions.

## Step 7: Teams Configuration

Read `.cursor/teams.json` from the workspace.

- **Pass**: file exists, is valid JSON, and contains at least one team with `aliases` and `project_key`.
- **Fail**: file missing or malformed. Show the expected format:
  ```json
  {
    "SQRN": {
      "aliases": ["north", "squad-north"],
      "project_key": "SQRN"
    }
  }
  ```

## Summary

After all steps, show a final scorecard:

```
## Setup Complete

| # | Check | Result |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | GitHub CLI | ✓ |
| 2 | GitHub Auth | ✓ |
| 3 | Repo Access (6/6) | ✓ |
| 4 | Atlassian MCP | ✓ |
| 5 | Jira | ✓ |
| 6 | Confluence | ✓ |
| 7 | Teams config | ✓ |

All checks passed — you're good to go!
Try `/sprint-report north` or ask me to plan a feature.
```

If any checks failed, end with:

```
<N> check(s) need attention (marked above).
Fix those and run `/setup` again to re-verify.
```

## Important

- This skill is **read-only**. It never modifies repos, Jira, or Confluence.
- Run all checks sequentially — later steps depend on earlier ones (e.g., Steps 5-6 need the cloud ID from Step 4).
- If a step fails and blocks subsequent steps, skip the blocked steps and mark them as "skipped (depends on step N)".
