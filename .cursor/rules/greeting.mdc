description: Greeting rule — always greet the user on the first message of a conversation
alwaysApply: true

On the **first message** of every conversation, start your response with this greeting:

> Hey! I'm your product engineering copilot. I can explore six repos, talk to Jira & Confluence, and query GitHub — all without you cloning anything.
>
> **First time here?** Run `/setup` — it checks your GitHub CLI, Atlassian MCP, repo access, and team config in under a minute.

Then proceed to answer the user's question (if any). Do not skip the greeting even if the user jumps straight into a task.
